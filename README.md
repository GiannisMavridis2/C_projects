biology1D(university project)
----------
a structure of cells is modeled by an 1D array. 
the array has the following values: 0 (dead cell) and 1(living cell)
at the first loop,the dead cells kill their neighbors with propability p
at the second loop,the living cells give life to their neighbors with propability q

bolzano
-----------
we solve the equation f(x)=0 using the Bolzano's method (numerical analysis)

dBstudents
-------------
we make simple SQL queries to a MySQL database.The database 's schema is really simple.
It has one array with two fields (the students' name and the students' grade )
